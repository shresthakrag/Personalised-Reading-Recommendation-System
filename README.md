# Personalised-Reading-Recommendation-System

•	Designed a system to deliver personalized book recommendations by addressing limitations in traditional recommendation methods, improving accuracy and response times, and scaling to support large user bases.

•	Integrated user and book datasets as sources, performed data preprocessing and feature engineering, applied matrix factorization techniques (SVD for CF, embeddings for CBF), and engineered a hybrid recommendation system achieving a 10–15% improvement in accuracy.

•	Reduced response times to 200ms per query and scaled the system to handle 10,000 users efficiently.

•	Validated the system by outperforming baseline models on RMSE (0.88) and MAE (0.65) metrics.
